# Hooks Example

> ## Rules of Hooks
> 
> Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:
> 
> * Only call Hooks **at the top level**. Don’t call Hooks
>   inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. 
> * Only call Hooks **from React function components**. Don’t
>   call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just
>   one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks.
>   We’ll learn about them in a moment.)
