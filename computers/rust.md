# Rust

Rust is a systems programming language. Think C or C++ level.

## Why am I learning Rust?

These are a few reasons why I am learning Rust.

### Rust is modern

Rust is a modern systems programming language. While other
systems programming languages have much wider usage from
having been around much longer, they also have a lot of
fragmentation in their usage, since they were pre-Internet. I
think for a beginner like me, this is not helpful, since I
donâ€™t want to worry about what Makefile or project structure
is the best. Rust has a package manager â€” Cargo â€” which is
incredibly helpful. Also, [the book] is super accessible.

### Rust is performant

Something I have noticed with a lot of modern applications is
poor performance. It has been frustrating as a user, but as a
developer I havenâ€™t felt equipped to properly address the issue
since all I know are higher level programming languages. Rust
will be my venture into writing more performant software.

### To learn more about computers

If this isnâ€™t included in my reasoning for any computer-related
learning endeavor, then I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m doing it.

### To help others

Another core principle that should drive all of my learning.

## Resources
